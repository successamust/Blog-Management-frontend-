## Nexus – Product Book (Non‑Technical)

### 1. What This Document Is

This document is a **product book** for Nexus – a modern blog and newsletter platform.  
It is written for **non‑technical readers, investors, and stakeholders** who want to understand:

- What the app actually does in plain language.  
- What features it offers to readers, subscribers, authors, and admins.  
- How all of those pieces fit together as one product.

You can:

- Keep this file in version control to track changes over time.  
- Export it as a PDF whenever you need a shareable “product book”.  
- Update it alongside new features so it always matches the live app.

### 2. Who Nexus Is For

Nexus serves several kinds of people:

- **Visitors / Readers** – people who just land on the site and read.  
- **Subscribers** – readers who share their email and receive newsletters.  
- **Registered Users** – people with accounts, dashboards, and saved activity.  
- **Authors** – approved writers who can publish posts.  
- **Admins** – people who run the platform and manage everything.

Each group sees a different side of Nexus, but it’s all the same app.

### 3. What a Visitor/Reader Can Do

#### 3.1 Browse the Home Page

When someone arrives at Nexus, they see a **magazine‑style home page**:

- A **logo and navigation bar** with links to Home, Posts, Categories, Search, and (if logged in) Dashboard and Admin.  
- One or more **featured articles** highlighted near the top.  
- A list of **latest posts** with titles, images, and short summaries.  
- **Trending posts** that are performing well (popular with readers).  
- **Categories and tags** to jump into topics.  
- A **newsletter subscription area** inviting them to sign up to receive updates.

It’s designed to feel like a modern online publication, not a developer tool.

#### 3.2 View All Posts

On the **“Posts”** page, visitors can:

- See a list of all published posts.  
- Read the title, short description, date, and author.  
- Scroll or use pagination to move through the catalog.  
- Click any card to open the full article.

#### 3.3 Explore Categories and Tags

Nexus uses **categories** and **tags** to organize content:

- **Categories page** – shows high‑level topics (for example, “Product”, “Design”, “Engineering”).  
- Each category page lists **only the posts** that belong to that category.  
- **Tag pages** – group posts with more specific labels (for example, “SaaS”, “Onboarding”, “Remote Work”).

Readers can move from category to category, or from tag to tag, without needing to know anything technical.

#### 3.4 Search for Anything

The **Search** page lets visitors:

- Type keywords (like “onboarding emails” or “dark mode design”).  
- See **suggestions** as they type, based on popular posts, categories, and tags.  
- Apply **filters**, such as:
  - Author name,  
  - Category,  
  - Tag,  
  - Date ranges.
- View a list of matching posts with highlighted search terms.

For logged‑in users, Nexus also:

- Remembers **recent searches**, so they can quickly re‑run them.  
- Lets them **save a search** (for example, “weekly: customer stories”) and bring it back later.

#### 3.5 Read a Post Comfortably

When a reader opens a single post, they get:

- A clean **reading layout** with title, author, date, and featured image.  
- A **reading progress bar** at the top showing how far through the article they are.  
- A **comfortable text experience**:
  - Good spacing and typography by default,  
  - Optional font and line‑height controls to tailor the reading experience.

If the author uses tables, images, or code, the layout keeps things readable and scrollable, even on mobile.

### 4. How Readers Can Interact With Content

Inside a post, Nexus turns reading into **participation**.

#### 4.1 Likes, Views, and Bookmarks

Readers can:

- **Like** or react to a post (depending on the configuration).  
- See **view and like counts** to understand how popular a piece is.  
- **Bookmark** posts for later reading, which are then accessible from their personal dashboard.

#### 4.2 Comments and Replies

Under each article, readers can:

- Leave **comments** on the post.  
- Reply to other comments, creating discussion threads.  
- See conversations in a structured, easy‑to‑follow layout.

Nexus can also hide or flag problematic comments, giving admins and authors tools to keep discussions healthy.

#### 4.3 Polls (In‑Article Voting)

Authors can attach **polls** to posts:

- Readers see a short **question** with several **options**.  
- After voting, they see **live results**: percentages and vote counts.  
- Depending on configuration, they may be allowed to **change their vote** for a short time.

Polls are perfect for quickly asking the audience things like:

- “Which topic do you want next?”  
- “How useful was this article?”  
- “What’s your biggest challenge right now?”

#### 4.4 Related Posts and Author Profiles

At the end of each article, readers see:

- **Related posts** chosen to match the topic or tag.  
- The **author’s name and profile**, which they can click to view:
  - Author biography,  
  - Social links,  
  - Total posts, views, likes, and comments,  
  - Followers and following counts (if enabled).

From the author profile, readers can:

- See all posts written by that author.  
- Follow the author (if they have an account) to see more of their work.

---

### 5. Newsletters and Email Updates

#### 5.1 Subscribing

On the home page (and sometimes elsewhere), visitors can:

- Enter their **email address**.  
- Choose **topics** they care about (for example, “Weekly Digest”, “Product Updates”, “Community Highlights”).  
- Give **consent** by ticking a box that clearly explains they agree to receive emails.

Nexus uses a **double opt‑in** process:

- After subscribing, the user receives a **confirmation email**.  
- Only after they confirm are they fully added to the subscriber list.

#### 5.2 Reading Newsletters

Subscribers:

- Receive newsletters directly in their inbox, with links that point back to full posts on Nexus.  
- Can revisit past newsletters in a **Newsletter Archive** on the site.

The **Newsletter Archive** lets people:

- See the **subject, preview, and date** of previous newsletters.  
- **Search** within the archive by subject or content.  
- Open and read archived newsletters as if they were posts.

#### 5.3 Unsubscribing and Managing Email

Every subscriber can:

- Click an **unsubscribe link** (usually in email footers).  
- Visit an **unsubscribe page** where they confirm removal.  
- Immediately stop receiving newsletters.

This builds trust and keeps the mailing list healthy.

### 6. Accounts and Personal Dashboard

#### 6.1 Creating an Account

Visitors can:

- **Register** with their name, email, and password.  
- **Log in** later to continue where they left off.  
- Use **password reset** flows if they forget their password.

Account security is handled centrally, so users don’t need to know any technical details; they just use familiar forms and emails.

#### 6.2 The Dashboard

Once logged in, each user gets a **personal dashboard**.

From the dashboard, they can:

- See an **overview** of their activity:
  - Posts they’ve liked, commented on, or bookmarked,  
  - Recent reading history.
- Navigate through **tabs** such as:
  - **Posts** – posts they own or collaborate on (for authors),  
  - **Comments** – comments they’ve written,  
  - **Likes** – posts they’ve liked,  
  - **History** – recently read posts,  
  - **Bookmarks** – saved posts,  
  - **Collaborations** – invitations and shared posts,  
  - **Settings** – account and profile details.

It functions as a “home base” for everything they do on Nexus.

#### 6.3 Profile and Settings

In the settings section, users can:

- Change their **name, bio, and profile picture**.  
- Add **social links** (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, personal website).  
- Update their **password**.  
- Adjust some **notification preferences** (for example, whether sound or browser notifications are enabled).

---

### 7. Becoming an Author

Not every user is an author from day one. Nexus has a clear, controlled **Author Application** process.

#### 7.1 How to Apply

From the dashboard, a regular user can:

- Click **“Become an Author”**.  
- Fill out an application form with:
  - Why they want to write,  
  - Their background and experience,  
  - What topics they want to cover,  
  - Optional website or portfolio links.

#### 7.2 Application Status

After submitting:

- The user sees a dedicated **status panel**:
  - Status: pending, approved, or rejected,  
  - Submission date,  
  - Optional messages or notes from admins.

While the application is pending, the user cannot yet create posts, but they can still read, comment, and bookmark like normal.

#### 7.3 Approval and Promotion

Admins review applications in their **Author Management** section.

They can:

- Approve an application, which upgrades the user to **Author**.  
- Reject an application, optionally adding **admin notes**.  
- Later, **promote or demote** authors if needed (for example, demote an author back to a regular user or promote someone to admin).

Once approved, the user sees updated messaging: they are now an author and can start creating posts.

---

### 8. Writing and Managing Posts (Authors)

Authors have access to powerful but friendly tools to manage their content.

#### 8.1 The Rich Text Editor

When creating or editing a post, authors use a **rich text editor** that supports:

- Headings, paragraphs, bullet lists, and numbered lists.  
- Bold, italics, underline, and inline code.  
- Quotes and call‑out sections.  
- Images and media.  
- Links and tables.  
- Optionally, **code blocks** and interactive snippets for more technical content.

The editor provides a modern writing experience with clear toolbars, clean typography, and live preview behavior.

#### 8.2 Drafts and Templates

Authors can:

- Save posts as **drafts** to revisit later.  
- Use **post templates** as starting points for common formats (for example, feature announcement, tutorial, case study).

Templates speed up writing and keep the voice of the publication consistent.

#### 8.3 Scheduling and Publishing

For each post, an author can:

- **Publish immediately** once the content is ready.  
- **Schedule** the post for a future date and time:
  - The post automatically goes live at the scheduled moment.  
  - Status badges like “Scheduled” distinguish these from normal drafts and published posts.

A dedicated post management list shows each post’s:

- Status (draft, scheduled, published, archived),  
- Author, category, tags, dates, and basic engagement stats.

#### 8.4 Post Management Tools

In the **Posts Management** section, authors and admins can:

- Search posts by **title or summary**.  
- Filter by **status** (all, published, draft, scheduled, archived).  
- View and sort posts in a table layout with key details.  
- Edit or delete individual posts.

Admins (and in some cases authors) also get **bulk actions**:

- Select many posts at once, then:
  - Change their status (for example, mass‑archive old posts),  
  - Delete multiple posts together.

#### 8.5 Version History (Where Enabled)

For sensitive or important posts, the system can keep a **version history**:

- Track major revisions.  
- See when each version was saved and by whom.  
- Compare and optionally restore an earlier version if a later edit has problems.

---

### 9. Collaborating on Posts

Nexus isn’t just for solo authors. It also supports **collaborations**.

#### 9.1 Inviting Collaborators

From a post, an author or admin can:

- Send **collaboration invitations** by entering a collaborator’s email address.  
- Specify a role (for example, co‑author or contributor) depending on the rules you choose to follow.

#### 9.2 Invitation Flows

Invited collaborators:

- Receive a **link** they can click to accept.  
- See invitations in their **Collaborations dashboard tab**, where they can:
  - Accept or reject,  
  - See which post each invitation refers to,  
  - See what role the invitation offers.

If an invitation is no longer needed, the sender can **revoke** it.

#### 9.3 Working Together

Once accepted:

- Collaborators gain access to that specific post’s editing area.  
- Multiple people can co‑write, revise, and maintain the post.  
- The post can show **collaborator information**, giving credit to everyone involved.

This is ideal for editorial teams, guest authors, or staff who help prepare content for subject‑matter experts.

---

### 10. Polls and Quick Feedback

Nexus includes built‑in **polls** so content owners can quickly collect feedback.

#### 10.1 For Authors and Admins

From the **Polls Management** section, they can:

- Create a new poll with:
  - A **question**,  
  - An optional **description**,  
  - A list of **options** (answers).  
- Link the poll to a specific post.  
- Mark a poll as **active** or **inactive**.  
- Optionally set **expiry dates**.

Admins can also:

- Edit existing polls.  
- Delete polls that are no longer needed.  
- Open **analytics** for a poll to see:
  - Total votes,  
  - Breakdown per option (percentages and counts),  
  - Export data (for example, to CSV) where enabled.

#### 10.2 For Readers

Inside a post, readers see:

- The poll **question** and options.  
- A simple, clear button interface to vote.  
- After voting:
  - A **bar chart‑style** view of percentages,  
  - The number of votes for each option,  
  - A running **total votes** count.

If configured, readers can:

- Change their vote within a limited time window (for example, 5 minutes).  
- Have a limited number of **vote changes** to prevent abuse.

---

### 11. The Admin Area (Control Center)

Admins access a dedicated **Admin dashboard** where they can see and manage the entire platform.

#### 11.1 Overview Tab

The Overview tab provides a **high‑level snapshot**:

- Total number of:
  - Users,  
  - Authors,  
  - Admins,  
  - Posts,  
  - Categories,  
  - Newsletter subscribers.
- Engagement summaries:
  - Views and likes,  
  - Comments,  
  - Poll participation.  
- Visual **charts** (bar, line, area, pie) to show:
  - Growth over time,  
  - Distribution of roles,  
  - Categories performance,  
  - Newsletter trends.
- **Quick action buttons** like:
  - “Create Post”,  
  - “Manage Categories”,  
  - “View Likes”,  
  - “Open Newsletter Panel”.

This is often the first place admins visit each day to get a feel for how the platform is performing.

#### 11.2 User Management

In **User Management**, admins can:

- Browse a list of all users.  
- See each user’s role and basic statistics.  
- Change roles:
  - Promote a user to **author** or **admin**,  
  - Demote users if needed (for example, admin → author, author → regular user).

This allows the platform to grow carefully and maintain trust.

#### 11.3 Author Management

In **Author Management**, admins primarily:

- Review incoming **author applications**.  
- Read applicants’ messages, bios, and links.  
- **Approve** or **reject** applications.  
- Add **internal notes** to help with later reviews.

One place handles the lifecycle from “reader” → “author”.

#### 11.4 Content and Category Management

Admins can:

- See **all posts**, not just their own:
  - Filter by author, status, category, and more.  
  - Perform **bulk operations** for migrations or cleanups.
- Manage **categories**:
  - Add new categories with names and descriptions,  
  - Rename or remove categories,  
  - See how many posts belong to each one.

Tags are more lightweight but can be orchestrated through the posts and search experience.

#### 11.5 Newsletter Management

The **Newsletter** tab gives admins a complete view of email activities:

- Key stats:
  - Total **subscribers**,  
  - Total **newsletters sent**,  
  - Average **open rate** and **click‑through rate**,  
  - Details about the **most recent newsletter** (subject and date).
- Subscriber list:
  - Each subscriber’s email,  
  - When they joined,  
  - Their current status (active/unsubscribed).
- Sending newsletters:
  - Compose a **subject line**.  
  - Use the **rich text editor** to create email content.  
  - Switch between **edit mode** and **preview mode**.  
  - Send the newsletter to the subscriber base with clear confirmation messages.

#### 11.6 Polls and Analytics

As described earlier, admins can manage polls and open detailed **poll analytics**:

- See votes over time.  
- Understand which options are winning.  
- Export data into files to use in external reports or tools.

---

### 12. Analytics and Insights

Across the app, Nexus surfaces **analytics** to help people make better decisions.

#### 12.1 For Admins

Admins can see:

- The **overall size and growth** of the user base.  
- How many people are reading, liking, and commenting on posts.  
- How newsletter performance is changing:
  - Subscriber counts,  
  - Open rates,  
  - Click rates.
- Poll results and post performance metrics (where configured).

These insights help answer questions like:

- “Which topics do our readers care about most?”  
- “Which authors get the most engagement?”  
- “Are our newsletters improving or declining over time?”

#### 12.2 For Authors

Authors can see, in simpler form:

- How many posts they’ve published.  
- Basic performance numbers like views, likes, and comments.  
- How their individual posts and polls are performing.

This helps authors refine what they write and when they publish.

---

### 13. Notifications and Real‑Time Updates

Nexus includes an in‑app **notification center**.

#### 13.1 What Triggers Notifications

The system can notify users when:

- Someone comments on their post.  
- Someone replies to their comment.  
- Their post receives new likes.  
- They get a new **follower**.  
- They receive a **collaboration invitation**.  
- A relevant new post is published (based on rules you define).

#### 13.2 Notification Center

In the header, users see a **bell icon**:

- A badge shows how many **unread notifications** they have.  
- Clicking the bell opens a **dropdown** with:
  - A list of grouped notifications,  
  - Filters to show specific types (comments, likes, collaborations, etc.),  
  - Buttons to mark individual notifications as read,  
  - A button to mark **all as read**,  
  - Options to delete or clear notifications.

Clicking a notification usually:

- Jumps straight to the **related post**,  
- Or to the **dashboard tab** where that event matters (for example, the collaborations tab).

#### 13.3 Sound and Browser Alerts

Within notification settings, users can:

- Turn **sound notifications** on or off.  
- Choose whether to allow **browser notifications** (pop‑ups) and adjust that preference.

This keeps users informed, but in a way they can control.

---

### 14. Design, Themes, and Accessibility

Nexus is intentionally designed to look modern and feel comfortable to use for long reading sessions.

#### 14.1 Dark and Light Themes

Users can:

- Switch between **dark mode** and **light mode** at any time.  
- Let Nexus follow their **system preference** if they want.  
- Have the app remember their **theme choice** for future visits.

#### 14.2 Responsive Layout

The layout:

- Adapts gracefully to **phones, tablets, and desktops**.  
- Uses a compact mobile menu that still exposes search, notifications, and account controls.  
- Keeps cards, text, and buttons sized for touch interactions on small screens.

#### 14.3 Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility

Nexus includes:

- A **“Skip to main content”** link so keyboard users can bypass repeated navigation.  
- A **keyboard shortcuts overlay** explaining useful key combinations, such as:
  - `?` – show keyboard shortcuts,  
  - `/` or `Ctrl+K` – focus search,  
  - `g` then `h` – go to home,  
  - `g` then `p` – go to posts,  
  - `g` then `d` – go to dashboard.  
- Thoughtful handling so shortcuts don’t interfere while users are actively typing in text fields or the editor.

These features make the app not only pretty, but also more inclusive.

---

### 15. Reliability and Staging (High‑Level View)

While this book avoids technical details, it’s important to know that Nexus includes a well‑thought‑out **staging setup**:

- The team can run a **separate staging version** of both the backend and frontend.  
- Staging has its own **database and secrets**, so experiments never touch live user data.  
- Deployments follow a **“staging first, then production”** pattern:
  - Changes are tested end‑to‑end on staging,  
  - Only then promoted to the **live app**.

There is also a documented **testing and release checklist** for:

- Local testing,  
- Staging smoke tests,  
- End‑to‑end flow validation,  
- Security checks,  
- Basic load checks,  
- Rollback practice,  
- CI/CD (continuous integration and deployment) guidelines.

For investors and leadership, this means the app is not just feature‑rich, but also operated with discipline.

### 16. How to Turn This Book Into a PDF

Because this book lives as a **Markdown document inside the project**, it’s easy to:

1. Open `PRODUCT_BOOK.md`.  
2. Copy the content into:
   - Google Docs,  
   - Microsoft Word,  
   - Notion,  
   - Any Markdown editor that can export to PDF.  
3. Use that tool’s **“Export to PDF”** or **“Print to PDF”** option.

For example, in **Google Docs**:

- Paste this content into a new document.  
- Go to **File → Download → PDF Document (.pdf)**.

Because this file sits next to the app’s code:

- Any new feature can be added here in the same pull request.  
- Stakeholders always have a **single, up‑to‑date source of truth** about what Nexus offers.  
- Updated PDFs can be generated in a few clicks whenever needed.
